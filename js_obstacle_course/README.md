# JavaScript Obstacle Course

Welcome to the JavaScript Obstacle Course. Here you'll find some sub directories containing challenges. The three first challenges contain a spec file and a JavaScript file with some code already there for you to get you started using ES6 classes. If there's another approach you prefer, please feel free to delete the code and start over.

## Up and running

`cd` into one of the sub directories and run the tests with the following command:

```sh
$ jasmine-node [name].spec.js
```

Unskip one test at a time and don't unskip the next one until you have the previous one passed.

Naming our test file with the extension `spec.js` allows us to run the tests with `jasmine-node`. If you don't have the `jasmine-node` npm package installed, install it with `npm install -g jasmine-node`. The `-g` will install it globally on your system.
